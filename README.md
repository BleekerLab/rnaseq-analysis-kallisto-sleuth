# A Snakemake RNA-Seq pipeline with Kallisto and Sleuth

A snakemake pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data that makes use of [Kallisto and sleuth](https://scilifelab.github.io/courses/rnaseq/labs/kallisto).

## Aim
To perform the _pseudo-alignment_ steps of RNA-seq (Illumina) reads to a transcriptome reference and output individual Kallisto estimates and produce a file of the transcript scaled counts.  

## Outputs
This pipeline analyses the raw RNA-seq data and produces:
1. A file containing normalized counts.
2. Individual Kallisto estimates that can be used for differential expression with Sleuth. 


## Content
- `Snakefile`: a master file that contains the desired outputs and the rules to generate them from the input files.
- `config/config.yaml`: the configuration files making the Snakefile adaptable to any input files, transcriptome and parameters for the rules.
- `fastq/`: This folder should contain single-end or paired-end reads, or a mixture of paired and single-end reads in fastq format.
- `envs/`: a folder containing the environments needed for the conda package manager. If run with the `--use-conda` command, Snakemake will install the necessary softwares and packages using the conda environment files.
- `config/samples.tsv`:  a file containing information about the names, the paths and the conditions of the samples used.
**This file has to be adapted to your sample names before running the pipeline**.

# Usage

## Download or clone the Github repository
You will need a local copy of the `rnaseq-analysis-kallisto-sleuth` on your machine. You can either:
- use git in the shell: `git clone git@github.com:BleekerLab/rnaseq-analysis-kallisto-sleuth.git`
- click on "Clone or download" and select `download`

## Installing and activating a virtual environment
First, you need to create an environment where `Snakemake` and the python `pandas`package will be installed. To do that, we will use the conda package manager.   
1. Create a virtual environment named `kallisto` using the `environment.yaml` file with the following command: `conda env create --file environment.yaml`
2. Then, activate this virtual environment with `source activate kallisto` or  `conda activate kallisto` (with `conda =>4.5.0`)
By using the software and package manager conda, Snakemake will then take care of installing and loading the packages and softwares required by each step of the pipeline.

## Configuration file
Make sure you have changed the parameters in the `config.yaml` file that specifies where to find:
- the sample data file `samples.tsv`
- the genomic and transcriptomic reference fasta files
- various parameters for certain softwares etc.    
This file is used so the `Snakefile` does not need to be changed when locations or parameters need to be changed.

## Experimental design (samples.tsv)
To get the right reads to the samples the 'sample.tsv' needs to contain certain features.
the column name of the column comtaining the sample names needs to be 'sample'
the column names of of the columns containg the forward and reverse reads need to be 'fq1' and 'fq2'
the column containing conditions, genotypes, treatment, etc is free of choise.

example of a file for an experiment containing paired-end reads:

| sample   | treatment | fq1 | fq2 |
| ------- | ---------- |-----|-----|
| sample1 | control | readsS1_R1.fastq | readsS1_R2.fastq |
| sample2 | control | readsS2_R1.fastq | readsS2_R2.fastq |
| sample3 | treated | readsS3_R1.fastq | readsS3_R2.fastq |
| sample4 | treated | readsS4_R1.fastq | readsS4_R2.fastq |


In case of an experiment containing only single-end reads, the column 'fq2' can be omitted.
The 'sample.tsv' will then look something like this:

| sample   | treatment | fq1 |
| ------- | ---------- |-----|
| sample1 | control | readsS1.fastq |
| sample2 | control | readsS2.fastq |
| sample3 | treated | readsS3.fastq |
| sample4 | treated | readsS4.fastq |


If the experiment contains both single and paired end reads, it should be something like this:

| sample   | condition | fq1 | fq2 |
| ------- | ---------- |-----|-----|
| sample1 | control | readsS1_R1.fastq | readsS1_R2.fastq |
| sample2 | control | readsS2.fastq | |
| sample3 | treated | readsS3_R1.fastq | readsS3_R2.fastq |
| sample4 | treated | readsS4.fastq | |

# Snakemake execution
The Snakemake pipeline/workflow management system reads a master file (often called `Snakefile`) to list the steps to be executed and defining their order. It has many rich features. Read more [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Dry run
From the folder containing the `Snakefile`, use the command `snakemake -np` to perform a dry run that prints out the rules and commands.

## Test run
Open a Shell window and execute these steps:
* `conda activate kallisto`
* `snakemake --use-conda --directory .test`

## Cluster execution
For cluster execution, please refer to the [Snakemake reference](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cluster-execution).
